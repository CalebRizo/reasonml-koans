# Reason Koans

Learn the [Reason](https://facebook.github.io/reason/) programming language by fixing code.

## Get Started:

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) is a prerequisite.  Once you have npm installed, do the following:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/inchingforward/reasonml-koans.git
cd reasonml-koans
npm install
npm run koans
```

You will be presented with the following error message:

    src/koans/AboutAsserts.re: true should be true.

This message is telling you that there is a problem in the `src/koans/AboutAsserts.re` Reason source file.  Find the error message in the source file and change the code to make it work, then run `npm run koans` again to find the next error.  Once you have fixed all errors, you will achieve Reasonable enlightenment.

## Status

2016-10-19: Still getting started.  Please check back for progress.

## Inspiration

Reason Koans was inspired by [F# Koans](https://github.com/ChrisMarinos/FSharpKoans) by Chris Marinos, which was inspired by [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/).
